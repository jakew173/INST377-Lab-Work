        <h1>Jacob Walter Lab 1: Intro to HTML</h1>
        <p>Within this lab I will describe what I wish to learn from this 
            class, as well as some of my favorite albums.</p>
        <h2>Things I hope to learn from this class</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>Learn front-end web design techniques</li>
            <li>Gain strong conceptual and practical web design knowledge</li>
            <li>Discover more of the back bone behind websites</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>My top 5 favorite albums</h2>
        <ol>
            <li><em>Revolver</em> - The Beatles: By 1966 the Beatles had fully 
            merged popular music with psychedelia,</br> incorportating 
            world instruments, tape loops, backwards guitar solos, layered 
            harmonies, and <strong><em>plenty</em></strong> of LSD.</br>
            All of these factors together led to a historical album,
            the likes of which no kid in the mid 60's could have anticipated.
            </li>
            <li><em>Fear Fun</em> - Father John Misty: A fantastical and 
            occassionally pretentious look into the world of smoking, drinking,
            </br>drug use, sexual escipades, romance, and art. Complete with 
            biblical allegories, acoustic ballads, and a <strong>very</strong> misleading
            stage name.</li>
            <li><em>Congratulations</em> - MGMT: Although MGMT is most known for
            easily recognizable Coachella hits, <em>Congratulations</em></br>
            provides a less pop-oriented approach, showcasing two close friends
            making pop music exactly how they want it: psychedelic, </br>
            experimental, and without regard for a record label.</li>
            <li><em>The Life of Pablo</em> - Kanye West: Although Kanye West
            has released plenty of other albums worthy of this spot on the list,
            </br>The Life of Pablo gave listeners an unbridled, experimental, 
            and incredibly intimate look into Kanye West's mind.</br> This 
            led for an erratic and somber journey into the world of 
            genius production techniques and struggles with mental health.</li>
            <li><em>I'm in Your Mind Fuzz</em> - King Gizzard & The Lizard 
            Wizard: A group of best friends making manic garage rock just for 
            the fun of it. </br> An album just as jagged and whimsical 
            as the band's name. </li>
        </ol>
